I am trying to implement a system where I can make a market place sort of thing where users can code their own widgets for grids for the data to be show in a certain visual representation or any other kind of widget, these are called ariesMods and need to be installed dynamically on the nodejs/react/electron hui either by dragging and dropping J's file or whatever way u suggest, but they need to be user customisable like libraries in Arduino

ive already made the drag drop ui and a new page in the sidebar for a areismods marketplace 

now its time to implement logic, we have the parse logic for drag and drop of the custom ariesmods to define custom reactive widgets

we need to implement listing widgets in the configurator
